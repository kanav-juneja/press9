Reuseable Multi-Level Drop Down

To run project, navigate to root directory, run yarn install, followed by yarn start.

Further Improvements -

1. Smooth transitions and animations.

2. Highlight active items in each dropdown.

3. Way to clear dropdown and reset to initial state.

4. Way to specify and ensure a user selects a value at a particular level of the dropdown. Example - to ensure user selects a 'Building', and does not drop off at 'Zone' level.
